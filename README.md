# ML Core Banking System Core Connector Test Harness
A development and testing harness for core connectors that support the P2P cross currency use case in a Mojaloop scheme


# Overview 
This test harness is intended to provide a core connector testing and development framework. The idea of a core connector came about as a result of the need to have an integration middlewear between the Mojaloop Connector (SDK Scheme Adapter) and a Financial Service Provider (FSP) Core Banking System.

# Developing a Core Connector
To develop a core connector, it is important to understand the different apis that the core connector needs to expose and those it needs to consume to support receipt and initiation of payments in a Mojaloop scheme.

Here is a diagram that illustrates role of a core connector in a typical mojaloop payments scheme

    Specification for Core Banking System Core Connectors Send Money API.

    This API is intended to be implemented by the Core Connector. It is used to 
    initiate transfers from a DFSP Operations application.


    **USE CASE AND SCENARIO**


    Assuming a customer in your DFSP wants to send money from their account held
    in your bank to another customer whose account is in another bank in the Mojaloop
    Scheme.
    Once the customer has initaited the transfer using your application, to effect the transfer,
    a POST send-money api call will be sent to this api. This api is to be implemented by the 
    core connector such it can receive requests from your Operations application which will then effectively communicate with your DFSP Hosted Mojaloop
    connector to be able to effect the transfer in the mojaloop switch.


    **Note on terminology:** The term "Switch" is equal to the term "Hub", and
    the term "FSP" is equal to the term "DFSP".
